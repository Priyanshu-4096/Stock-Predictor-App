## üìà Model Architecture

The application offer powerful machine learning model:

### Neural Network (MLP)
- **Architecture**: Multi-layer perceptron with 3 hidden layers (100, 50, 25 neurons)
- **Activation**: ReLU activation function
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer with adaptive learning rate
- **Regularization**: L2 regularization (alpha=0.001)
- **Best for**: Complex pattern recognition in stock data

## üìä Technical Indicators

- **Moving Averages**: 20-day and 50-day MA for trend analysis
- **RSI**: Relative Strength Index (14-day) for momentum analysis
- **MACD**: Moving Average Convergence Divergence with signal line
- **Volume Analysis**: Trading volume with 20-day moving average
- **Price Returns**: Daily percentage changes and volatility
- **Volatility**: 20-day rolling standard deviation

## üîç Feature Engineering

The model uses advanced feature engineering including:
- Price-based features (Open, High, Low, Close)
- Volume and volatility measures
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Moving Averages)
- Statistical aggregations (mean, std, change ratios)
- Time-series window features for pattern recognition

## üìè Performance Metrics

- **RMSE**: Root Mean Square Error (lower is better)
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error (average prediction error)
- **MAPE**: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (percentage-based accuracy)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

**This application is for educational and research purposes only. Stock market predictions are inherently uncertain and this tool should not be used as the sole basis for investment decisions. Always conduct your own research and consult with financial advisors before making investment choices.**

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Warnings

- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Stock prices can be highly volatile and unpredictable
- Machine learning models may not capture all market dynamics
- External factors (news, events, economic conditions) significantly impact stock prices
- Model predictions are based on historical patterns and technical indicators only
